# Main changes in version 3.0

## API changes

- Populse_db cannot work with Python < 3.9
- Databases created by previous releases cannot be used by populse_db 3.0.
- Field types are now expressed as Python types instead of strings. For instance `'string'` is replaced by `str` and `list_boolean` is replaced by `list[bool]`.
- class `ListWithKeys` is removed. It was used to wrap the document content to avoid to copy all the field names that were known in the collection schema. This is no longer the case. Different documents of the same collection can have different attributes not registered as fields.
- All documents are now represented as standard `dict`.
- Exception class returned by methods may have changed. For performance reasons, we heavily rely on internal database system to raise exception when a problem arise rather than checking beforehand.
- `clear()` method was remove from `Database`, it is now in `DatabaseSession`
- Object returned by `get_collection()` is now a `DatabaseCollection` (it was a database row embedded in a `ListWithKeys`). Its name is in `collection.name` (instead of `collection.collection_name`) and its `primary_key` is now a `dict[str,type]` whose keys are the primary key fields and values are their type. 
- In `add_collection()` the `primary_key` default value is now `primary_key` (used to be `index`). To allow multiple value keys, it can have the following types:
  - `str`: Create a single column of string type that is a primary key with non null constraint.
  - `tuple[str, ...]`: create a primary key composed of several string columns each having non null constraint.
  - `dict[str, type]`: create a primary key composed of several columns of the given types each having non null constraint.
- It is not possible to create two collections that differs only in case. This is because collection names are directly used as table names and, in SQLite, table names are case insensitive.
- Removed obsolete parameters of `Database` constructor: `caches`, `list_tables` and `query_type`.
- Removed `add_fields()` method. There is no optimization in using this method, this is just a shortcut for calling several time `add_field()` without supporting all its parameters (only the four first).
- Removed obsolete parameter of `add_field()`: `flush`.
- Parameter `field_name` of `remove_field()` only accept a single `str` value, not a `list`.
- `get_collections_names()` returns a generator instead of a list.
- `get_collections()` returns a generator instead of a list.
- `get_field_names()` returns a generator instead of a list.
- `get_fields()` returns a generator instead of a list.
- Removed individual value methods `get_value()`, `set_value()`, `add_value()`, `remove_value()`. User must be aware that a document must be handled as a complete set of values.
- Removed obsolete parameter of `set_value()`: `flush`.
- Removed obsolete parameter of `set_values()`: `flush`.
- Removed obsolete parameter of `remove_value()`: `flush`.
- Removed parameter of `add_value()`: `checks`. More generally, many checkings had been removed to improve performance.
- Renamed `get_documents_names()` to `get_documents_ids()`. The result is now a list or a tuple since there can be several values per document if the collection has several primary keys. 
- `add_document()`: removed obsolete parameter `flush`. Default value for `create_missing_fields` is now Ì€`False`.
- `add_document()`: parameter `document` cannot be a primary key anymore, only a document dict.
- `DatabaseSession.check_value_type()` is now a global module function.

## Internal changes

- Removed `engine.engine_factory`. The corresponding work is handled by `Database` class.
